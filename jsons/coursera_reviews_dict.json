I personally would have liked a bit more in-depth discussion of Javascript as it went a little quick for me, however I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to learn some web development skills.", "Best Programming Lecture EVER!!!!", "Excellent", "Yaakov is an excellent instructor, as long as you are able to listen, and do the coursework, you have an opportunity to learn quite a bit from this class.", "Loved it. This is the teacher I like the most.", "There was very less practice and understanding of AJAX compared to other topics like HTML, CSS and Javascript. Very less hands-on practice was there for AJAX, otherwise the course was very well set up and very well explained!", "A really great course combined with a very good teacher makes for a great learning experience. A very beautifully designed course which takes you from the basics to quite advanced levels. Anyone looking to start learning web development, look no further!", "It's a great course to learn web development.", "Great information. Wish it would teach more individual css instead of base on bootstrap but very helpful.", "The Javascript part isn't explained that nicely but overall it's a very good course.", "I enjoyed every moment of it. The explanations are very thorough and it seems that Yaakov is answering the question that you're going to ask in a moment...", "Very helpful and informative course!", "Absolutely loved Mr.Yaakov's teaching. I began learning web development long ago before dropping it as most of the tutorials out there were not exciting and really lacked in organisation of material & fundamental concepts. Either the tutorials were too slow or went over the top. Kudos to Mr.Yaakov for making the course interesting, dealing more with fundamentals and for the way he integrated HTML, CSS and javascript topics on a real-world website. I for sure learned more regarding web dev over past week more than ever.", "Nice course for beginners", "A really great course!", "Nice, but not the best.", "Nice one!", "As an Iraqi student I have to give huge thanks Yaakov Chainkin. He is enthusiastic and explains the materials very good. I hoped to know more about navigation bars, anything else was amazing. Also, I think the organization needed some sort of simplification. I really hope if this professor can teach in our American university.", "Thank you professor Yaakov Chainkin.", "Very clear and well organized!", "Very good course, 100% recommended.", "Great course! Love it!", "It was great!", "I enjoyed the html and css portion of the cs but the java script portion is not for beginners.", "This course provides a concise introduction to the topic.

It is not just a one time thing. Students should keep coming back to take all kinds of tips from Yaakov. I guess the Rabbinic education has a great role to play in his approach. Baruch HaShem, you even wear a kippa to the lecture.

I think that this course gave me information that will help me in my future career. This course is easy to understand although it gives you good knowledge.

This course surprise me because the teacher brings to me relevant information where some stuff come from and how to use it in a consciously way.", "Very fundamental!", "If you don't want to actually learn what anything means and just get walked through steps on how to do things then take this course. But if you're a beginner to HTML, CSS, and Java Script, this isn't for you. He doesn't actually TEACH you anything, he just takes you through the process. They haven't updated the course content to actually match what is on GitHub's page, so from the start you have to go into the FAQs to figure out where to go from there. It's really frustrating because he will just skip steps, and because he doesn't explain WHY he's doing something, if you miss a step, you get completely lost. I've taken a few coursera courses, and this was the most frustrating course I have taken.", "Really good, teach me the basic skills of web development.", "Awesome course.

I did have to do extra reading and coursework outside of the course to fully absorb the javascript portion of the course.", "Very good teaching.Thanks you very much sir.", "A well-designed course that allows me to understand the web development concepts. Each section is clear and flows to the next section. A great teaching method that makes you think and try out the changes. It does not matter if you make mistakes, the tutor as your back, and provides the before and after source code. Brilliant, other course providers should follow a similar method.", "amazing", "Just great", "Excellent course to start with HTML/CSS/JS. Many thank to Johns Hopkins University team!", "very bad course but i have come to the point that it is ok for the beginers", "Excellent course! Instructor develops a real-world website in the videos and builds the conceptual understanding of web development through a \"this is the problem and this is how we'll solve it\" approach. Don't miss out on this great course!", "I give 5 stars for this as the coverage of HTML and CSS is like teaching for Dummies. JS and Ajax there were little not so easy to follow. But its certainly lot better than many premium courses available on net for HTML and CSS.", "Great course!", "I loved this course. It filled in a lot of knowledge gaps that I had. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the JS portion went a little fast, and it was difficult for me to keep up with it having minimal experience with JS.", "Great course!!!", "Professor yakov taught very well this course.

The classes had a good pace and every topic was made very clear. The exercises at the end were a good challenge that matched the level of the course and gave us that extra incentive to push a little bit beyond.", "The Javascript part was a little faster than the previous two topics (HTML and CSS). If only one thing should be corrected at this course I'd say that the same pace should be followed for Javascript.", "I'd definitely recommend this course as a great introduction and one of the best courses I've taken at Coursera so far.", "Great Introduction .!! Great place to start web development it helped me so much.", "Excelent course !!", "Explained in very simple way.Excellent course to proceed with.", "Any most aspects an excellent course. The teatcher is engaging and inspiring. The only thing that I have to be negative about is that the pacing is a tad fast in the javascript part. Some concepts would be better understood with more examples and repetition.", "Very good course!", "Great course. The instructor is able to simplify complicated stuff, grasp, focus on teaching core concepts of latest html, css, and javascript functions through using real example/application. This helps me as student to quickly understand the technologies and apply them without spending too much time or losing focus in every details. The exercise and assignment is very helpful to measure what we learned and how to apply them.", "I have really enjoyed this course, especially the real-life content in which Yaakov helps an actual restaurant develop a better website. I also really like the focus on the Twitter Bootstrap framework since this is an awesome time save for CSS! Yaakov makes it really easy to follow along, even with complicated issues, and I immensely appreciate his attention to detail when explaining the \"why\" behind the use of certain tags and classes when using Bootstrap.", "Excelente! Los conocimiento desplegados en el curso son muy completos! En lo personal repeti cada leccion y estudie los fundamentos varias veces, ya que hay cosas que de repente se pasan por alto pero que si se considera el tiempo que dura el curso (5 semanas) es mas que entendible. Tratar de ir mas alla requeriria mucho mas tiempo. Sin embargo vuelvo y repito el contenido abarcado es bastante, y al finalizar estas en plena capacidad de empezar a contribuir en proyectos de desarrollo web. De verdad excelente y gran parte de la calidad de este curso se debe a Yaakov y su tutoria dinamica y para nada aburrida.

Highly recommended.", "This course was a very good intro for me to get to web-development. you will learn enough while the whole course is fluid and easy to pass.", "Excellent course, complete and fun, recommended 100%", "Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated. For example, it doesn't cover the update version of github website and how to use it. That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing. Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment. It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for.", "Writing html, css and javascript made very accessible", "Very good course :D Easy to learn from the teacher Mr. Yaakov- and good coverage of material with videos.", "I learned very much in this course.

Everyone who wants to improve their frontend skill should take this course. It is intuive, concice and very clear! And the instructor is AMAZING and FUN!", "The course is quite thorough for a basic course and is challenging in pace. The work load is higher than the guidelines suggest for someone who hasn't done any programming for a while and is not familiar with object-oriented programming", "Yaakov is very knowledgeable and presents the material in an accessible way. He throws in some humor, which helps with absorbing the material. The quizzes are good learning guides and are appropriate for the material in the course. They require some thought, but adhere to the topics in the course without assuming additional knowledge. The exercises are difficult and take more time than the listings. But the reference materials are helpful and the online forums are very useful in clarifying points of uncertainty. I found some of the assignment descriptions, especially in modules four and five, to be unclear and it took some additional research to understand the intent of the task.", "The registration process and installation of the needed software was clearly explained and easy to accomplish. The software worked well with the course and enhanced the learning experience. I especially liked the way BrowserSync worked with Sublime Text and Chrome. The Chrome analysis tools are very useful. The use of Github as a coordinating platform worked well, for submitting assignments. The Coursera UI was very efficient at tracking progress and coordinating the peer level reviewing.", "Overall, I enjoyed the course and found it well worth the effort despite the few frustrating hours that always accompany grasping new skills.", "best teacher ever :)", "Excellent course.

However, I think more time should be spent on the last topics as they're more complex to understand 8for me at least!).", "Very thorough, helpful, and well structured.

As an obviously experienced developer, Mr. Chaikin provides you with modern techniques of using Javascript and responsive design. You'll probably encounter most of these techniques in the real life of a developer. The course is centered on practicing and the pace is fast. Don't be mislead by the colloquial tone and the quality humor present in lectures. Although the humor is good, you'll need to replicate most of the code examples on your machine, if you want to feel you've really learned something at the end of the day.

The videos are nice and short and Yaakov is an extremely good presenter with lots of enthusiasm. There are a lot of review questions which builds up confidence. I personally found the ajax part to be over my head - because we are jumping into the code without a basic conceptual understanding of what the structures in the axaj wants to achieve.

All the parallelism is just obvious division of a one big piece on several small pieses, and perfrom parrallel tasks on it. It's enogh to write merge sort with several threads to get the main idea, which is proposed here. You don't need to watch 4 weeks of coursera video and perform tasks to get it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I expected something more than trivial division. Besides that, I don't like the tasks. And I hate the last one week. Very bad description of the problem, it made me really suffer. I'd like much more the first 2 courses. Which I rated as 5 and 4 accordingly, but this one is fail.

I like course. But I had trouble with finding reason of some failed tests. It is very annoying when test fails, you lost some points but reason is unknown - if test failed for some particular reason it doesn't mean that that particular check or part of implementation is incorrect: reason can be in some other place not covered with test at all. Hope more tests will be provided, and for each fail will be possible find particular incorrect function or even check in some function. Full coverage by tests for each tasks can make course learning much more efficient.", "Interesting course, but far too short. It ends up giving a quick introduction to some of the aspects of parallel programming. I enjoyed the assignments, apart from last one where the difficulty was more about the context of the example than any parallel programming aspects.

In other words, understanding what the problem is takes far more time than solving it. The Lego-assisted teaching is a definite plus though!", "should contain more details", "Good course. The only thing I would suggest to improve is in the Assignments, the error messages are not always sufficient information to recreate the bug that caused the error, so it is hard to correct the bug (since if you don't recreate the bug, you don't find the root cause). On the other hand it's understandable, that giving away too much info from the grader makes it easier to \"workaround\" the failed test without necessarily providing a good solution.

The materials were good and I can use some of the ideas straight after the lectures in my everyday coding, but the assignments were really slightly related to the topic.", "Barnes Hut simulation assignment. I'd say it has nothing in common with parallel programming in Scala. It looks like the authors looked for some real-life example or use case for Combiners and this simulation model looked nice. But, really, does any developer not working in university would ever use it? It's completely impractical, the most of the time I spent reading the description of simulation model, but the coding itself was just playing with 2D coordinates and some basic recursion. I'd expect something more practical, e.g. implementing simplified form of Hadoop map-reduce or something like that so I can use it after the course.

Excellent way to crown the specialization's courses.", "After several back to back dense, high paced, steep learning courses in the specialization, this course is a welcome break. Its light, interactive and has a certain calmness about it. It touches several topics like shiny, manipulate, googlevis and plotly.

I hope the typing pattern match is sufficient to affirm identity.", "I have one comment on content specific to this class. Week 3 content lacks relevancy to the project and data products in general. I agree that knowledge of R packages, classes, and methods is an important part of understanding R. I am not sure where that fits in the Data Science curriculum as a whole, though. Maybe expanding the curriculum to include a second, more advanced R class, with a project to write our own methods, build an R package, or do something with yhat.

Now I'm writting my reports with RStudio.", "In general, an excellent course, taught by competent professors. I believe that in the main this course does very well in achieving its objective of knowledge transfer. However, having experienced it, there were parts where the professor was demonstrating a topic using a video presentation showing him operate a process or screen sequence on his computer. These aspects, like virtually all the material on this course, are of a technical nature and contain many important details. As such, to help complete and re-enforce their learning, students require something like a sequence of slides that they can print out and retain for revision and future reference. In certain parts, the provision of the printable screenshots in the form of slides was absent.", "An important theme of the course and Data Science in general is \"Reproducible Research\". What I'm arguing for here is, \"Reproducible Learning Materials\" covering a complete course, not only parts of it. Admittedly, it was only a very small proportion of the course that suffers from this defect. But I would not like it to become the norm in the future. As a suggestion, it could be possible to author a lecture using HTML so as to combine the verbatum lecture text with every slide/screenshot image embedded in its right position within the lecture.", "I notice Coursera courses have also moved away from the weekly lists of individual lectures together with their links to .txt, .mp4, etc. files. The new presentation keeps you submerged within the flow within each week's series of lectures. One has to 'click out' in order to watch your progress and then re-enter the lectures at a resumption point. I prefer the previous navigation structure in order to access lectures and materials. Printed learning materials are also important for me, in addition to the video lectures. The latter are of course vital as the medium for the initial exposure of the material.", "Taken this course in its old fashion style. Now reviewing the new design was a little bit displacing, but I ascribe this to the fact I've done all the specialization courses in the old design.", "However the structure of the course is quite good.

Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map? So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications.

Daniel Lakens for the win!", "This was a really well presented course, giving a fantastic overview of inferential statistics and always presented with a sense of humour! A number of really useful tools where introduced which I will be using again and again.", "It is good indeed. Such course is needed more on Coursera.", "fun and very informative course - thank you very much!", "Easy to follow, light workload, and most importantly: very useful material of supreme importance.", "This course is totally awesome! Statistical inference is critical in any science. Why collect data if we do not know what to infer from the data? Unfortunately, many disciplines use outdated or incorrect practices. This course provides an excellent review of state of the art approaches and provides students with many thought-proving opportunities to practice their inferential skills. As a professor of Psychology, I am not embarrassed to say that I learned lots from this course. The lectures, demos, and R scripts are useful tools that I will integrate in my teaching and my own research. Although the course topic is challenging, the course is organized well and does not drown students in technical terms. However, if you take this course, you better be serious and dedicated. The course is challenging, but the knowledge and skills gained are a rewarding experience.", "Amazing learning experience", "Great course. Daniel explains everything clearly and with examples in R code which makes all of the concepts easier to understand. A must-take for experimental psychologists.", "I encourage all my friends in research to not do anything before doing this course! The pedagogical touch is different to any stats classes I've been on or stats MOOCs I've taken. After many lectures, I was just left staring at the screen, with the phrase \"I must tell everyone\" repeating in my head :)", "Extremely useful cours, especially the first 5 weeks! Pleasant and enjoyable. Definitely recommended!", "highly recomended for all level. The explanation is very beginners friendly.", "The video is ok, but it lacks a lot of details in calculation. The assignment is very confusing because some questions refer to some 'previous' statement while fail to clarify which is related.", "I'm so glad I took this class! I learned how to better design experiments and interpret common statistical practices in the literature. The lectures are entertaining and informative, and the professor is charming and funny. Even though I'm an immunologist and the course is aimed at the social sciences, I feel like a better scientist now.", "Great course, much appreciated. Thanks a lot", "Some courses are useful in the short run while others can challenge your way of thinking for the rest of your professional life. This course is the latter!", "Very well designed course, from a didactic as well as from an entertainment point of view. I was able to close many gaps in my inferential statistics knowledge and now feel much more confident in my interpretations.", "Fantastic, enjoyable, entertaining with a dash of humor. Highly recommended for non-statisticians interested in improving their grasp of the field.", "Dear Daniel,Let me thank you for this marvel of yours. Your course helped me to revise and to (re)structure previously learned issues, it enriched me with new contexts that were presented in a truly enjoyable way, and last but not least, it gave me completely new insights including the role of simulations in teaching.Many thanks for your work!", "This course was great. I have worked with statistics for a while but always grappled with some concepts. Having completed this course, I feel much more confident in interpreting findings and designing studies. This is especially the case for Bayesian statistics and likelihoods that were not even part of the curriculum when I went to university.", "Excellent, may I say indispensable course for every social scientist out there to improve their statistical skills. Very coherent and comprehensive!", "Great lectures and really helpful simulations. Very engaging and interesting. Full of useful resources.", "This course really delivers on its core premise: it helped me understand the core principles behind frequentist statistics, gave me some basic understanding of Bayesian statistics, and will definitely prevent me from chasing my tail as far as potential future research is concerned.", "Although the course seems to be addressed to current and future researchers, I would recommend taking it to anyone interested in science as it will give you tools to read and understand research papers (esp. the basic reports in social science/experimental psychology).", "I would consider this course an excellent resource and introduction to the so-called \"new statistics\", and covers topics crucial to conducting reproducible research.", "The lectures are wonderfully taught and explain everything clearly. The hands-on assignments are challenging for the right reason: they test your knowledge and comprehension of the material at hand (some on-line courses did a number on me, and required extracurricular knowledge in order to succeed with completing the assignments).", "I think that even stats newbies might be able to take the course and learn a lot, as most of the material pretty much addresses the basic, core philosophy of statistics, and you don't need to know how to conduct specific tests in order to understand what Daniel is trying to share with you.", "This course is *the* course for anyone eager to understand what their stats 101 classes failed to even address.", "To get this out of the way: The one star deduction is not related to the content of the course, only to the fact that there is occasional imprecise language and some parts of the material have typos and grammatical slip-ups that show that the course has room for some tightening up.", "That being said, the selection of topics that are covered is great. You get a small but full package of both knowledge and tools that'll help you to significantly (no pun intended) improve your research. Not only are statistical pitfalls covered and solutions offered, you also learn something about how to approach your research with the right mind-set in order to produce solid empirical knowledge that contributes to a cumulative science.", "I was particularly impressed by how the instructor manages to pack lots of important topics and concepts into his 10 or 15 minutes lectures without it becoming overwhelming. The key to this is his ability to maintain focus and his generally clear and concise language. The course material, too, reflects the ability to present just the right amount of information - not too little, not too much.", "Overall, the course feels very pragmatic and hands-on. It proves that good and fruitful science is doable and that you can start right now. It makes you *want* to start right now.", "Clear explanations of the concepts of statistics, without too much emphasis on the formulas. With handy references to online tools, like power calculators.", "Really nice course! begins from basics but gives you a deeper understanding of concepts.

You must pay in order to access the assignments and the professor's in-browser python sandbox.", "Python Data Structures is a good course and well thought out. There are plenty of resources to help the student, my only recommendation would be that the assignments moreso force the students to use the relevant concepts rather than allowing work arounds.

Thanks Dr. Chuck for unmass, organize a way to teache python ina such easy way of learning.", "As the second course in the specialization, I continue to find the material covered to be useful and fairly easy to learn. Between the first and second course, I feel like both courses were able to lay and build upon a foundation of knowledge with each chapter covered. I did find the second course to be a little more difficult, but one would expect this with the addition of more code learned.

For each topic, the theory is clearly presented first( but just enough to start an example) and then explained by coding examples. A brief summary of the theory will be made at the end so you get a chance to re-think about it. And since this course is about a framework, he doesn't just show you how to use it, but also explains how some functionalities are achieved by the framework. He even tries to explain why uses this framework, or any framework at all in the beginning, which may seem obvious but actually not, at least according to my experiences.

Programming assignments really well thought and helps you to grasp major concepts of the framework not only from theoretical perspective, but with important \"hands-on\" experience. Finally, the author of the course goes deeper into software engineer career and recommends books like \"Soft Skills\" which in my opinion can give you a lot of realistic insights on the industry.

This was one of the most challenging courses I have taken on Coursera but I felt like I got a lot of knowledge out for the time I put into the course. My personal suggestions would be to split Week 2 into two separate weeks (the material there was a huge step up compared to Week 1 and there was a lot of it) and possibly include more examples for Week 3 (especially for directives since I thought that was the most difficult part of the course). Overall, I highly enjoyed taking this course from such a wonderful professor.", "I enrolled in this course based on the description, which mentioned that we will build a fully function web app at the end. That literally means, at the end of the course. I was expecting to build the web app from the beginning of instruction all the way to the last video. Instead, the code to the web app is on github. The instructor gives very clear explanations for interpolation, directives, expressions, etc and shows what the code looks like in a javascript file.

Currently it's sometimes difficult to get useful feedback", "Great Class, I have learned a lot stuff", "With this course I really learned how to think about a game idea.", "This seemed like a somewhat outdated course but did have a lot of basic info for people who want to make a game but haven't given it much thought. I also found the quizzes and review options frustration due to poorly worded questions and rating choices, as well as the lack of a written feedback option besides comments. Some of the videos seem to kind of drag on a bit as well, but overall it was still helpful for developing my game despite feeling like I didn't gain much new information.", "That person should not teach. Nobody. The person is not able to construct a sentence without denial and course has really little information, but lots of empty talking.", "Excellent course, it was sure difficult at the beginning but be patient, at the end you will be amazed of the amount of game design skills you've learned! Thanks a lot professor O'Donnell!", "I probably have to rate this course 5 stars just for the supplementary reading materials provided. There's a lot of great information provided here. This course helps formalize a process that highly talented people just do intuitively. With the information within, you're able to better understand different aspects of your creative process. At times, the professor's delivery can be a little distracting (he has quite a few awkward pauses in the middle of thoughts, and uses the phrase, \"right?\" a little too unconsciously). I also found some of the lecture material difficult to connect in a practical sense. Some aspects of the design, play, experience model could use better examples in lecture to make the points more concrete. It is a deep model, and they do in fact point you to a whitepaper published on it so there is that, but just for the sake of the lessons; the examples need better explanation. The quizzes were easy, but challenging in the wrong way. Often, questions are posed that weren't ever directly answered in lecture or the materials, and sometimes they are worded in ways that make it difficult to pinpoint what they are looking for. It would be nice to see student responses to the free-response questions make a comeback in future lessons or at least know that they could possibly carry into the material used to teach the next incoming class. The assignments follow a logical progression, and again are supplemented with great materials. The review system is a little wonky. I've posted in the boards about this. They need to make the criteria more clear. The community activity is pretty low. I'm not sure how this can be addressed, but overall this is a great course and perfect second stop on the journey towards the Game Design and Development specialization.", "The quizzes were too short to be effective, and without requiring written feedback from peer review, the process doesn't seem very useful.

Gives you the basic foundations you need for the specialization.", "I will review this course appointing its pros and cons.", "Pros:", "- The instructor: he is a captivating person. It really seems that he like game development, he make jokes and try to make the course interesting. So, he\u2019s personality is makes the course less boring.", "Cons:", "- The course name: when I saw \u201cdesign\u201d in the course name and the icon of course page, I thought it would be related to graphic design, or history telling and so on. But no, the \u201cdesign\u201d means \u201cproject\u201d. So I think a better name would be \u201cPrinciples of Game Project\u201d. Although, it might be just me who thought this way, because in my language design means something totally different.", "- The course content: this course should be at the end of the specialization. It is too much abstract and, in some aspects, very obvious. I will not say it is completely useless, because it is not. It gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation, but I think it would be better if it was like a case study.", "- The assignments: probably the worst part of the course. They very very complex, to be sincere, none of the assignments I reviewed were full, I gave max grades to many because I think the person tried really hard to make it. Imagine this situation: you are not a programmer, not a graphic designer, not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea you\u2019ve been working on course. This prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics, should be playable\u2026 And can be non digital? Come on, we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype? Some people did it, and I can say for sure that I couldn\u2019t imagine the real game. I made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course, but as you can imagine, it is not enough to make our game ideas come true.", "- The peer review system: the grading is completely non sense, as I said before, the assignments are complex, so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document, without the abilities to make concept arts or something. In 2 of the 4 assignments 2 of the 3 people gave me max grades and 1 gave me bad grades, and did not left any feedback! One of the assignments when I first submitted it I got 12/20. Then, when I resubmitted it, without changing a comma, I got 20/20. So I think this system must change, maybe the mentor should do it.", "If you want to do all the specialization, ok, go and do this course.

I am already familiar with software dev documentation, so a lot of it was not new for me. The style of teaching in the previous course was more pleasant for me. But I am well aware it is just a personal preference. Very good course indeed. Thanks!", "Hard fun.", "This course was a little stressful, but it seriously pays off. The instructor was excellent, he explains everything clearly and gave us quizzes and projects not only to do, but to really learn from.

I highly recommend this course for avid learners and those that would love to work hands-on on projects that concern Game Design.", "Excelente Curso", "The lecturer is very engaging and for the most part these lectures were valuable. A few of them bordered on \"why are we talking about this?\" though. Felt more like filler than actual value. I think this could have been condensed to three weeks without losing much.", "A really interesting course which details how games are designed from the inception of an idea, and what kind of work goes on before the actual development of a game. The instructor is absolutely brilliant.", "It appears the teacher doesn't take the necessary steps to polish content and tests, everything feels unstructured and ad-lib. Course videos don't seem to follow any kind of logic or purpose and tests are based on highly subjective content, but are not prepared to deal with the subjectivity of reviewers (i.e. forcing them to provide feedback instead of giving points arbitrarily).", "Excellent and amazing, motivate you to use your brain and imagination.", "The first steps into the world of making games. All those important documents that you have to write is all well explained here. I highly recommend for everyone.", "This course gives great insight to the importance of planning out the various structures of a game before building it.

Helpful.", "After the excellent first course in the specialisation, this was quite a disappointment.", "I realise that the subject matter in this course will inevitably involve abstract concepts and subjective opinions, but I didn't really 'get' the way that Casey was presenting the subject given that there were quizzes and assignments to follow.", "That's not to say that the videos aren't interesting. But, given their rambling style, they would be much more useful as reference material rather than driving the course, in my opinion.", "Many of the questions in the quizzes felt like they'd been added simply to make them up to the correct number. Some were so loose that you could write any answer and I'm sure you'd get a mark!", "Also, I'd say not to even start this course unless you have a clear idea for a game. The assignments require you to produce design documents that are tedious, going on impossible, to write without some firm rooted idea to start from.", "Maybe if you really want to be a game designer then this will be the course for you. If you are doing the course out of curiosity, for fun, or to learn how to control Unity, I'd give it a miss.", "Very comprehensive and thorough introduction to game design. I gained lots of insight into what it really takes to be a developer, and the steps involved. This course really helped to explain the process of getting a game idea off the ground, fleshing out details, and making it presentable to a team or prospective producer. Thanks!", "Teaching style a little loose for me, but man did he make me work on my assignments. The information is valuable and the references are beneficial. My take-away from attending this course gives a good base on how to think about a game and set things up properly from the start. No quick short cuts here. Just good old fashion hard work and how to approach things logically to get things done constructively and productively.", "It would a 4.5 star actually.

It does not give you the answers, but it gives you a road map to follow.", "Downside of the course are Quizes and Peer Reviews. Quizes sometimes have shady and non-clear answers, especially for non-native English speakers. Assignments grading criteria makes your peers to choose from 1 to 5. And 5 is \"you did so awesome, that you've impressed your peer very much\". And this is not happening often.", "A pretty nifty course for game design. I loved getting to work on the documentation planning for the game I was creating. Simple and easy to follow.

I think you have some great things to say, but perhaps streamlining those ideas and editing out the times when you need to pause to think (which is definitely legitimate when recording yourself!) or other things of that nature, would have definitely cut down on the length of the videos. Long videos aren't bad, if they are well put-together and conveying information in an engaging way.", "Great course for fleshing out ideas.

The first 2 assignments, a high concept document and a story bible were doable.", "But a full GDD and a prototype on week 3 and 4? These aren't part-time tasks for a few days, these are full-time tasks for at least a full month each to do them properly from scratch. These assignments are so unrealistically hard that they demotivate. And I'm saying that as someone who already had quite some ideas for one game and even started experimental programming.

I would change the name of the scoring, makes it easy for people to give bad grades.", "Not very informative content, some parts are interesting but not worth the money.", "The worst thing is, all assignments are writting work that are evaluated by colleagues, meaning, it is purely objective, to the extent that one question asks if my uploaded file is in a readable format, example pdf, txt...etc and two out of three marking my pdf file as not!!! and not even leaving a comment why they are giving that bad score on obvious things!", "It is very well structured, easy to watch&listen course. Highly recommended!", "The information is great, but I think they need to make this course in two phases because there was a lot of information to process and the assignments need more time if you want to do a good work. The other part that I didn't like was that the information doesn't really correspond to what you actually need to do for your assignments, I think the course needs more videos and examples of how to create the required documents.", "An exceptionally informative course that covers the more intricate principles behind the actual design of a game (not to be confused with the more technical aspects of development). From brainstorming ideas to developing a concept to actually testing your game before release, this touches on the more difficult thought processes that one may not learn by simply picking up a game engine and learning how to build a game from the ground up.

The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.", "Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, \"results\" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.", "The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.", "In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.", "Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.", "If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else.

The material is disorganized jumping from one topic to another and back. The quizzes are just plain dumb containing questions like \"what article was written by authors x, y, z\". The homework is barely related to the material and one of them, the one that made me abandon wasting further time with this class consists of wasting a huge amount of time (days) configuring parameters and running an application over and over again to tune them(waiting up to ten minutes on my i7 machine to make one pass over the data). My impression is that this guy didn't spend any time to prepare this course and just used the material/homework from a more advanced class that he did previously. You will not learn almost anything by taking this class, as none of the topics is explained well and is the opposite of self contained.

The introduction to NLP was a bit long, assuming that people who take this course know what NLP is about and why it is difficult for computers. However my main critics is the lengthy programming exercises that were badly described. I spend a significant amount of time just to try to figure out what to do. It required reading of papers and chapters of books to understand the algorithms. I missed the formulas and methods in the lecture notes. A little bit more technical details in selected topics (that are used today) and less of a broad overview of historical approaches would earn 5 stars from me.", "Great overview of many of the most important topics of NLP.

First, it's not well-organized. Sometimes you need to look at next week's course to do this week's quiz. The programming assignment is VERY VERY unsatisfying. It's not explained clearly; there's no helpful instruction; and it is very confusing. You need to spend hours and hours just UNDERSTANDING what you need to do.

If discounted the weekly videos with real examples of frauds, per week there was only about 20-30 minutes of 'real' materials.

Virginia and Yale are packaging in their top courses/specializations at least 1.5 to 3 hours per module (what can have between 4 and 11 modules), plus resources - slides, readings, excel spreadsheets and others. This is an enormous gap. Also - although it was positive to see the materials of the collegue and acfe sites, more was expected. For example, it would be extremely valuable to have resources related to Bernie Madoff, Armstrong, Edward Snowden to engage on a more dynamic discussion. The slides used to back the video lectures should also been made available. Also in some topics more detail was expected. For example, Benford's Law.

Learned a lot.", "very good", "The swirl exercises are very good. The assignments are quite challenging but enjoyable. The last one took me > 9 hrs. I would suggest to first give a sample assignment. And then in the theory discuss the tools for that assignment. And then give the assignment. The theory is a lot of explanation - which I am battling to \"hook\" onto something. Why - because I had not been exposed to an application opportunity. The text in the slides are too small to view on a phone. Overall I feel proud to have completed the course and it gives me confidence to attempt problems with R.", "Great Course!", "The course was great. Having no background in programming languages is surely a set back to complete this course. The first time I enrolled for this course, I cant go any further than a week. But in my second attempt I was determined to complete it and I did it. What I understand is, if you have passion to learn R , this is a nice course but you cant rely on the class teaching alone, there are quite a number of blogs from where you can get help to complete this course. I felt a huge gap between assignments and the teaching; means, one has to struggle a bit to complete the assignments. But may be thats how one can get better with the nuts and bolts of R. Again, the course discussion forum and a few blogs can guide you through to understand and complete the assignments.", "I learned a great deal in this course about manipulating data in R.

While the concepts are presented in lecture, without some discussion my grasp of the material is weak. swirl() helps immensely - the programming exercises are really key for learning the concepts. The discussion groups [TIPS] kept me in the game.", "I had really high hopes for this course. I am not a programmer, though in college I learned C, C++, and used MATLAB a fair amount. I wanted to learn R because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use SPSS which I have done in the past. I had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course. I went through the slides and I didn't really feel like I learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field. As a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tank.", "I then took the time go through two swirl assignments which I hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides. They were definitely more helpful than the slide show, but I still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiply.", "So in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming, otherwise you will do what I did and just wasted $50.", "Overall, this course was fairly challenging and at times I would get frustrated, but every minute was worth it after realizing the knowledge I have gained and have been able to use in the real world. I think sometimes the assignments just kind of dive right in and there's not much hand-holding, but that can be a good thing. My only suggestion would be to extend the course from 4 to 6 weeks and spread out the material a bit, but overall, you just have to be committed and make time.", "Excellent course", "very helpful\uff0c easy to comprehend and follow", "Can move too quickly at times, but is very informative.

Why not work on this during Week 4 through an assignment that works on this? This would have made it easier to focus on the research questions of the project and less on the graph making mechanics. Also, I found that the project was a little bit too open-ended and could have used some more input from the instructors' side.

Mentors are reallly of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insights, they know the subject matter.", "But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use.", "One example: in the lectures on probability, the first \"slide\" in the lecture talks about random processes, outcomes of random process,... On the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of \"event\" was never introduced. It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course videos, that fact should be made clear.", "Further in the course on probability, some words are used \"interchangeably\" without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeably. For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes. Which is which??? Is there a difference? If so, what is it? When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?", "The graded assignments are of varying quality.

I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content litterally minutes after failing the question (and one mentor actually rightly corrected me). But the question \"correction\" (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of \"two-sided hypothesis test\". Where did THAT come from?? I checked and rechecked the course videos, no mention at all of it. I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely focusing on inference.", "The second occurrence was in week 4. The course lectures cover two distributions: normal and binomial. The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distributions (the recommended reading actually skips the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well). But in one of the quiz question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution. If it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distributions, then the course content should cover the subject. Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that learners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.", "The guidelines for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the learners. Sure, there are instructions on where to find the info, what structure should be followed,... There is also a very nice \"example\" project (designed by one of the mentors), which provides a lot of useful info (how to filter missing values from variables,...).", "But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete. This is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other learners, from what I gathered in the discussion forums. The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparate levels. Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving trends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,... The thing is that the peer review criteria do not really provide a good basis to ensure that learners did indeed assimilate the course contents. Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself.", "For instance, some of the peer review criteria have to do with the narratives for computed statistics and plots. The criteria are: \"Is each plot/R outout followed by a narrative\", \"Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics\", \"Does the narrative address the research question\". But when the research question is a question of the type \"What it the IQR for income per state\", for instance, the narrative can be very short: \"IQR per state shows that the state with higher variability of income is...\". So, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criteria: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics. But it is not particularly useful.", "I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for \"neutral\" criteria that are easy to assess by learners. But the peer review grading \"grid\" as it currently stands is not \"that\" helpful in assessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.", "To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization.

I've enrolled in other Coursera courses that use R, Python or Octave, and they all provide clear demo videos for beginners to get up to standard with the code.

More responsive mentors - especially nearer the end of the course - would be really helpful.", "It was a well taught course", "I really liked this course.", "The course comprises of lectures, which are clear and are rich in examples, and of practical assignments, which you do in R.", "The practical tasks is where the course shines - everything is explained very clearly, there is a lot of content, and the course works with databases that are huge (thousands of cases and hundreds of variables) and have some of the more common problems (eg. missing data). I have little to no prior programming experience, just for the record.", "Mind you, this is an introductory course, as the name states, so don't expect to be a master of R or data handling after finishing it, but I feel I learned a lot here.", "Great course to help you get started in statistics.", "Fantastic course.

Besides it constitutes a very didactic introduction to ggplot2 and dplyr.", "great course so far!!", "Can not find a single flaw in teaching, and in assignment design.", "Need more R class", "This course is highly rigorous and requires you to put in hard work and time. It is a perfect course to build foundations.", "This course is definitly suitable for learners who don't have any related background. Dr. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel has an amiable speaking style and always highlighted the key points in teaching videos, which helped me understand other contents in the textbook. Besides, the time and assignment arrangement of this course are also very reasonable. The only thing I could complain about is a system bug of the Amazon AWS and the grading system. My final project file went blank after the system told me the file uploading is sucessfully completed on August 3, and I got three 0 point from three peers since they only saw a blank file, of which I had no idea, and all I could see is \"Grading in progress\" on the system. Until the final grading day is over, which is August 12, the system finally reminded me of this horrible thing. I came to mentors, disscussion forum as well as the help center, reuploaded my file, desperately tried to find peers who can still spare some time to review my file, and it is finally fixed today. I got my certificate in the end, but the grading process is really frustrating. Hope this bug won't happen to anyone ever ag", "I like this course. The material is presented clearly. The home work is well defined.", "Simple delivery with quality reading and video materials.", "Excellent course. Very engaging. The amount of effort the team has put in is very evident.

The quizzes and assignments make it more interesting.", "Professor Cetinkaya-Rundel's explanations are clear and she gives many examples, the quizzes are fair and I think it is an excellent idea to have a lab in R to get students familiar with that tool.", "I recommend that students read the book chapters and do the practice problems there, it's very helpful.", "My one criticism is that the amount of R taught in the course is not really enough to do a good job on the capstone project, because the data in the given database is formatted very differently. I think maybe the course staff could reformat the database to make it more user-friendly for beginning R users, but in the meantime you may want to study a little R on the side at, say, DataCamp.", "Dr. Mine \u00c7etinkaya-Rundel is awesome! Her lectures are very comprehensive!!! :)", "A great course for a practical introduction to R and to statistical concepts.

It's a petty and unimportant kind of criticism in an otherwise wonderful course.", "If everyone taught stats like Prof. Cetinkaya-Rundel, this important subject would have been a whole lot better understood and utilized globally.", "One of the well made MOOCs. There are many courses in Coursera taught by good professors from good universities but are badly designed for an MOOC environment making it a bad experience. This course is really well designed. The contents is modular and lectures are split into easy to grasp chunks. The weekly lab exercises using R using real datasets is a plus. Though not much of R syntax is taught and it is up to us to explore(understandable since the goal of this course is not to teach R). The final project was a bit challenging but fun.

It is a wonderful", "The content of this course is not terribly difficult, I thought, but it's a very good introduction into most aspects of Data Science. You learn to familiarize yourself with R quite well and get a lot of independence to create a final project based on a huge data set.

It's amazing that the course authors offer a statistics textbook almost exactly covering the course content for free. The idea to combine R and statistics is right on the money too, thanks to this one can learn 2 skills at the same time, with statistical analysis letting you practice coding in R and R helping you visualise your statistics. The lectures are divided into small, easy to absorb chunks and the teacher does an excellent job explaining the material, giving very good examples and analogies to help the students understand concepts. The exercises and assignments are fun to complete, and the course offers a flexibility in how much time you spend on it per week, e.g. there are non-mandatory exercises to do.", "It took less than 3 days overall for me to finish this course, but I did this just because I wanted to refresh the basics and see if I am missing something. At the end I learnt quite an amount. Prof. Rundel's explanation is clear and concise.

This course is not only good in its content and rigor, I also found that I was able to absorb mathematical concepts much better than I would in a pure Math class. I typically took about an hour per 20min of lecture and paused in the middle to really take in the maths, and that helped a lot. The non-academic highlight of the course was definitely Prof. Rao sense of humor.

On the other hand, the lectures were mostly at a superficial level, so I'm not sure that technical people would get much out of them either. The only topic that got a (somewhat) deep dive was serial communication, and it wasn't clear why; users of the Arduino don't need to understand it any more or less than any other aspect of how an Arduino works.There were other issues. The programs we wrote had to be pasted into a submission form that removed all the carriage returns when you hit Save; I had to manually fix my program each time.

I paused to work through the very awesome \"Head First Ruby\" book and it gave me the skills to move on. What the course does well is show you how these many interdependent elements work together: Ruby, Rails, Sublime Text, homebrew, rbenv, rspec, httpparty, heroku. It's a lot to take in and you really have to explore each subtopic a little more on your own to make it work, but you finish with a pretty rich understanding of the ecosystem of tools and frameworks you need to be effective if you do. Definitely overall recommend, but know that you're going to have to do some work on your own.", "Really enjoying this class. Instructors and classmates are very helpful when encountering issues.", "A really nice way to get introduced to the whole framework. You don't spend too much time on any one subject. Instead, you get your feet wet with Ruby, the very basics of Rails, and how hosting on Heroku works.", "Thank you!", "Was great to make this course on RoR here. Thank you very much!!", "Definitely not for a beginner.", "Wish there were more visuals, and assignments to do alongside the professor. Instead, it is a lecture from Power Points, that don't really line up with the assignments very well.", "If you have previous knowledge in another language, you'll do fine, but if you're truly looking for a beginner course, look elsewhere.

In the end I don't think it was any better than any of the free online tutorials out there. The instructor spoke so quickly in the videos he was nearly incomprehensible. The explanations were incomplete at best and most of the time amounted to nothing more than \"type this... now type this.\". I'm well aware that the only way to learn programming is by doing it yourself, but if I pay for a course I expect an explanation of how things work under the hood. I was looking forward to taking the entire Ruby On Rails specialization, now I'm not so sure.", "Very practical, makes easy for the student to go over the installation and configuration hubs, to-the-point introduction to Ruby on Rails. At the end of this course, I was able to write a decent looking web application, develop an understanding of the core concepts, and obtain many references to the helpful technologies and documentation. This course might have been better only if it were revised for the versions of 2017: if the student ignores the specificity of the versions in the initial installation instructions, the final homework will to be rejected by the automated grader. Shorty put, most recent Rails version is not compatible with Ruby 4.2.x.", "Great course!", "This is a great course and a great teacher. I learned the basics of ruby (language) and Ruby on Rails, as well as other tools such as heroku and rspec.

(but i still highly recommend the course.)", "Awesome Course. Ruby is really great and easy.", "good learning", "I thought this course was very disappointing, to the point where I'm not able to finish it. In week one, we learned some basics. In week two, the entire language was dumped on us with no real exercises. Then we were asked to write some programs. The programs didn't build knowledge piece by piece - it was just learn the language, now write these random programs. It was very disappointing. I sign up for courses because I want to learn piece by piece and get to practice each new thing. If someone is going to dump the whole of Ruby on me in 1 week I don't need the class, I can buy a book and get the same experience. There also wasn't a good grader provided. This really took the joy out of programming. I keep thinking I'll come back and finish the class but I haven't so far because I dislike how it's presented so much. A true disappointment.", "Assignment is unclear and confusing.

Also, the teacher is very good and eloquent.", "Excellent course. i have learnt a lot from this course and the instructor is very cooperative. looking forward to do the next course", "Could have been more interactive .The ruby course that I studied from lynda.com was far better than this", "3", "Good. But as the course is rather short, knowledge is not covered in detail and may easily be forgotten without extra practice.", "A very awesome course, especially for beginners !", "Overall this is a great course, but I do wish that the written materials be revised and clarified. The course videos are great! Prof. Kalman Hazins approach is prefect for online teaching! However, the instructions for the programming assignments were not as clear as they needed to be. There was more than one occasion where I had to spend considerable time trying to figure out what was being asked. And for a newie, any amount of confusion can stop can be completely debilitating and frustrating. It can be the difference between giving up and becoming a developer.", "nice course", "Awesome! Easy way to get started to ruby and ruby on rails!", "Well designed, well delivered, with good pedagogy.

Look forward to the others.", "Thanks", "It was a really good course, although a bit 'dry' (lessons were similar to each other and thus tiring in longer perspective).", "Great intro to Ruby!", "Short course but enough challenging and interesting. I really like the short course to update my skills on web development...3-5 week course are really good!", "This course provided very accessible startup material. The most valuable piece, I think, was the introduction to Git - it provides a very powerful tool set for its users.", "This is a wonderful course and it helped me a lot. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start with rails.", "Excellent course.", "It is obvious that a lot of effort has been put into producing this course but the assignments were just a bit too difficult. They were too involved and very unforgiving of small mistakes. It took more like 8 or 9 hours of problem solving and debugging and having to try different things and there was one every week so it became pretty frustrating as it really ate into my weekend.", "This course is really well done (structure, material, examples, tests etc.). It is especially useful for people who already know some programming language. It provides a complete representation of good application (git, tests (rspec + Capybara + phantomjs) , heroku, using some API etc).", "The course contains only 3 modules, but this modules contains essential information for junior RoR developer.", "Also I'd recommend to read \"Head First Ruby\" during the course. The course and the book helped me to dive into ruby during one week.", "This introductory course teach good basic knowledge and you can apply it after the course. Excellent!", "Thanks to Kalman Hazins and JHU for the wonderful introduction. The course provides for a hands on introduction to the MVC framework along with the Ruby programming and Rails deployment.", "The only setback I had was during the purchase of the course. My amount has been deducted from the bank, but no intimation from this is obtained, neither from Coursera nor Paytm. Please DON'T RUIN YOUR IMAGE because of this. Except for that , This is an excellent course material. Loved going through the videos and assignments. Was equally challenging and FUN to learn ROR", "Thanks :)", "PS : Please initiate the Re-Payment process or at least reply to student's grievances in the Help and Support Forum.", "very good instruction!", "One of the best thing about this course is that even the Lecturer and Mentor will reply to your question. Some may say that is out-dated but I don't think so, and if so the Mentor will try to give you a solution to that out-dated information. The assignment is not too difficult, just revise with a little bit advance knowledge but it's okie.", "This is a good tutorial!", "Thank so much teacher.", "Very good introduction course, thanks!", "Awesome course designed by professor...very well explaining means why it's need and where we can use it.

You can learn!", "Great course. I recommend it.", "This course is a very good option to start your adventure in Ruby on Rails framework. It starts from the very beginning, I mean, you learn some Git, how to set up your programming environment in order to use Rails, Ruby and useful tools like PhantomJS, and much more.

The lectures are clear and of a good quality as well as course assignments. The one think I really didn't like is that if you use a new version of Rails you'll have to downgrade. It's not a big problem but new versions bring new functionality and give more power to the developer.

I found this course quite challenging because there was so many new concepts covered in very rapid fashion: Ruby, Rails, Rspec, all other tools.

They also offered a number of practice assignments with self grading capability which is a nice feature.", "The graded programming assignment for week 2 gives a lot of information about how to set up your environment and steps/commenting to assist building out your code. However there were a few requirements for the graded portion of the assignment that they don't even tell you about (expected return values under certain situations) until you actually run the grader. They weren't difficult but their reasoning were never explained in the course and it made the code a little more awkward than it needed be to pass.", "Week 3 is where the major pacing problems occur. There are a number of very broad stroke videos on Rails, as well as several brief videos covering a number of third party libraries or tools sometimes required to build Rail apps. A lot of the content they cover isn't even utilized in the assignments of the course.", "The week 3 assignment instructions are actually incomplete. They tell you a number of pre-required packages you have to install, including ones you had installed from previous assignments, but they leave out others you will need and leave several development environment issues you end up having to work out on your own.", "And where as the week 2 assignment was almost overly hand-holdy on showing you where in a ruby file structure to implement your code, week 3 hardly offers any guidance on where or how to implement your Rails structure. The broad stroke videos from week 3 kind of give you an idea as to what each piece of code is doing if your working from a template, but the assignment feels obfuscated when trying to build it from scratch.", "A major issue also comes from a third party website they require for completion of the assignment (and that requires separate registration to use). During several periods, over multiple sessions of the course, the third party site went down and was unavailable for as long as 48 hours at a time; during which it was impossible to properly run or debug the assignment due to its requirement.", "What the assignment is asking for isn't even terribly difficult when you do understand what is required, and the code is rather simple and minimal to implement. But you end up having to figure out a lot of that either off site (in which case you are not learning from the course) or by modifying a copy paste of some of the templates/scaffolding from the course GitHub content, in which case you don't get a good reinforcement of the material.", "In the end I wound up getting a certificate, feeling like I passed despite the course rather than because of it.

Not too slow or fast, plenty of content covered well with references for more detail.", "I did spend way longer than 2-3 hours for each week's lessons though, more like 3 solid days from start to the end of the assignment.", "It is worth info into.", "Initially I thought this was a great course, but my optimism quickly dissipated. The homework assignments all required information that wasn't covered in the lectures, forcing hours of searching for answers. During the week, questions in the forums were answered within a day or so, but there was no help at all on the weekends. If I got stuck on a Friday night and couldn't find an answer myself, I had to wait until Monday to get a reply from an instructor or teaching assistant.

Having completed over 10 Coursera courses over the year, and numerous other online classes, this is officially the worst. For me personally, the whole course was a complete waste of time. Put it simply, the presenter can't teach, at least not the MOOCs. There were no structure. The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate. After drumming how important to actually \"code\", he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides. After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didn't even use it. After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he won't explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture. As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform. It was bits of code here, bits of code there. Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning. I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.", "As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller.

I should have asked for my refund within the first week, but I felt since I was paying, I would stick it out a little longer. You will get a better explanation if you take each subject and youtube the videos on each subject. Very useless course.

I've been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. I've written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automated tests, posted on course forums (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by switching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.", "I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger,", "Some lecturers have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting.

This is a hard course to teach to begin with. I found the lectures really boring, too long, hard to understand and just not really motivated well. I think the homework problem are good, but they are very time consuming. You need to use various methods to find edges cases and though that might be a good skill to have as well, it's just too much to get done in one week and somewhat frustrating when you're only stuck in one test case. I think this could be an excellent course with a few modification on the slides and adding more motivations and making shorter homework problems that focuses on the main part of the material for that as oppose to things we've already covered in the previous week.

I'm obviously not an expert in this field, but I've been an educator before, and my own impression of the assignments was that they were extremely well designed: it was impossible to pass them without knowing what you were doing, the tools to approach them were always found in the lectures, and the challenge problems pushed your knowledge even farther. I would recommend the specialization to everyone.

Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.", "Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.", "All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: \"We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail.\" presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.", "In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.", "In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy.

You get an introduction to a lot of \"greatest hits\" from Computer Science, but at a level where you come away understanding the technique.

The instructors have put together an excellent introduction to the wonderful, and scary, world of algorithms. I must admit I was ready to send my PC flying through the window on numerous occasions when I could not get my particular implementation of an algorithm to run within the time AND memory limits set by the instructors. More so, because often you are not told what particular test case made it fail.

Really awesome for beginners in Algorithms.", "nice stress testing is now i am learned", "I agree with some of the reviews here. It's fantastic at the beginning of the course. Towards the end, unfortunately the professor's accent is heavy and sometimes difficult to understand. The subtitles don't help either because they were auto-generated. My brain had to take extra cognitive workload to decipher what was actually said before trying to understand the materials on the slides and everything else. I also didn't like the way index 0 and 1 is mixed in different lectures. Why shouldn't we stay consistent in pseudocode using index starting with either 0 or 1? The slides are confusing regarding this matter especially when you translate algorithms into code.", "Nonetheless, I liked the assignments overall. The course's instructors included some of very interesting problems and indeed helped understand the lessons better. I also liked the course structure and the carefully prepared slides.", "So awesome. The challenges were great and I learned a lot!", "This is a good course, and I liked the quality of video lectures. The material is structured and lets the students understand the basic approaches they can follow to solve algorithmic tasks.", "Also a good plus is that there are assignments. First, they are of different complexity - so anyone will find an interesting task there. Second, there are prepared starter files for 3 languages - so you spend time working on algos, not on bootstrapping projects. And third - grading is automatic.", "Just for fiuture - as a more engaging thing there could be also made tasks to review of other people's assignments (as it is done in other courses) and implementing a test case which makes a wrong solution to fail (which is something like TopCoder does). But this idea is too raw and needs more thinking.", "Update: As I proceed to wk 5, I know why there are some complaint on Dynamic programming,", "Reduced to 2 stars.

I enjoyed every single moment. The assignments constitute the biggest part of understanding and learning.", "Testing cases are claimed to be generated randomly, in that way why can't we get the random test case to improve our result?

The discussion boards and professor's lectures were particularly helpful along with the fact that I could download everything for viewing offline.", "Very detailed and well covered", "More information should be given for the failed test cases. Is a waste of time to find bug if you don't know what the bug is. ie test case 4/13 in the minimal dot product assignment", "I always wanted to improve the algorithms and data structures field. The books wasn't so efficient. Especially they weren't so practical. These courses are the first courses where I really got a lot of knowledge. Especially because of assignments. All lectors are very good in explanation of the material and tell many additional useful things. These courses are the really good base, after which you can open the books related to algorithms and read more details if you needed.", "I am definitely going to complete the whole specialization!", "The only thing which was not convenient for me is that both courses Algorithmic Toolbox and Data Structures are started at the same time. It was difficult to find out the time for both courses and spend enough time to solve all assignments instead of only enough for passing.", "Anyway, now I am started the second iteration of the course and I am going to solve all assignments which I skipped.", "Big thanks to Daniel, Alex, Pavel, Neil and Mike!", "Regards,", "Sergey", "Even though this course covers a lot fundamentals for introduction to algorithm, the course itself is not designed as good as I expected. For starters, the weekly problem designs aren't very good. Some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples. Often, the input format/arguments are designed to take redundant info. Some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs, which is just confusing for learning purpose.", "In terms of lecture videos, it's good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video, however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained. For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all. I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that it's more difficult to explain proving steps). Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better.

I learned nothing and felt no challenge whatsoever, in fact, I felt as though I was rehashing information from a 9th grade English class (no hyperbole). The other component of this class was learning how to create documents that you could use to pitch your game to developers. I found this component to be useful, but it could have easily been compressed into a single week if not a single lecture. There is no real accountability when it comes to grading work, as work is peer graded and students grade capriciously without regard for the criteria laid out in the lecture. In other words, most students responded to how cool or interesting they found my assignments, without regard for the weekly lecture or the grading criteria. It often felt as though the lectures didn't matter at all. Right when the class begins to introduce a more robust tour of laying out a game story, it suddenly ends. This class is only useful to students who are interested in an area of game design besides writing and who are taking the whole series anyway.

The strategy hinges on a series of outlines--taught with examples and exercises--that eventually fit together in a comprehensive design document, which allows a designer/writer to organize ideas and make them comprehensible and engaging for potential readers. The examples used are great, covering games both simple and complex; and the exercises grow gradually less structured, ensuring that the skills necessary to develop an idea from scratch are gained along the way.", "It's pretty good, but it has some things I perceive to be flaws. First of all, this course is entirely about writing a narrative for a game. It uses the examples of Starcraft 2 and Angry Birds. Neither of those games are particularly known for their narrative, but he uses Starcraft 2 as a more heavy narrative example and Angry Birds as a light narrative example. He goes on to talk about how adding implicit narrative elements help engage the player by exploiting their emotions, etc. etc. I don't find these examples to be particularly engaging - especially the cynical cash-grab that is Angry Birds.", "Such a boring course. No challenge at all, no meaningful example, and in the end seems that everybody grade without any reason. I don't think I'll finish the specialization, it's too expensive for such a poor quality", "This was an excellent course, and gives a lot of insight and techniques to develop a good and intriguing story.

The only thing I would have to say is that the last task was a bit difficult for some of the coding and there was no assistance of someone I could have reached out to. i.e. if I was having a hard time with a certain aspect in Scratch that I had a difficult time with, I would have loved somehow to ask for assistance to better understand what I was doing wrong and/or why it was not working", "You will have to make a Scratch account (free) for this course.", "Areti is a very clear instructor that explained concepts very well for complete beginners into programming, like myself and I found the course insightful.", "1) Presentation - I couldn't help but wonder whether they had a lower target age (teenagers or younger) in mind, which was entertaining at some points but also distracting at other times. // Also, I only realized halfway through the course that it is in fact possible to see what Areti is doing on the Scratch program once the quality of the video is adjusted.", "2) Projects/Time Commitment - Going through the lectures and quizzes are not time consuming at all, but the projects (especially the final project) takes a lot of time. It took longer than expected because I felt like much of the practical instructions on how to use Scratch for specific purposes were not provided during the course, leaving me to work by myself.", "3) Discussion Forum - When I took the course, the discussion forum was close to being dead (especially compared to some of the other courses that I was taking simultaneously on Coursera). Gerry (mentor) did an amazing job responding to my inquiry, but I noticed that although there were a lot of students talking at the beginning, introducing themselves, there weren't that many discussions concerning the final assignment, making me feel like I was working alone. It would be great if there was more time to work on the final project, and perhaps a way in which students can collaborate and help out others when faced with a bug (ie preliminary project submission and feedback session).", "I recommend taking this course, but realistically, you won't be program proficient after 5 weeks. You will, however, learn some basic programming theory, understand how programming works, and learn how to make a fun interactive game on Scratch!", "very well explained and the whole course is so fun to learn !!!! and very motivating too for programming beginners....!", "I thoroughly enjoyed this class.

It's well thought out, offers insight, and gives a chance to hone skills. Very good intro to character design- for comic writers as well!", "This course is exceptional! it really helped me improve my designs and was super fun to participate in!", "A very interesting experience. I got imagination level-up. Though it was really difficult to understand what should you do in each assignment. I've spent quite a while time to realize what to do each time. And some students did their homework completely wrong.

Super videos!", "I learned a lot from the teacher, and the guests gave useful insight into the industry", "really good", "This course was great, like other courses from this series.

Excit", "Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful, when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn't place any emphasis into it. So for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all. Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like \"Eat3D\" and many others out there, which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here! It needs to be deeper and more robust if this course wants to stand out, right now is not.", "The best course that I have passed!", "great professionals!", "For the first course, you will only be drawing. You will not learn anything about programming video games. It was nice that they showed famous artists for cartoons, but the videos felt too long, with dialogues that felt like rambling at times.", "I would have liked to get input on my work by an instructor instead of just other students, but it was a good exercise to hone my skills. I wouldn't pay for credit because I feel like my work isn't being professionally graded.", "Really good course, must be done with the rest of the specialization.", "Really fun course. The different artists have pretty interesting tricks and tips, which can significantly improve your character design skills.", "Great course! Great teacher! Fun, engaging and very useful. I've been using the first four courses from CalArts Game Development Specialization to develop a game idea I've had jotted down some time ago and I've found them to be the best thing I could've done to get my game going on the Narrative and Visual fronts. I've been doing the first four courses in the five course specialization as an unpaid observer, but after taking these courses, I'm signing up for the full specialization. If the quality holds true, the project driven fifth course will be amazing and well worth the money. The teacher in this particular course (Same teacher as in the Introduction to Game design class) is funny and entertaining to watch. Definitely goes the extra mile, doing interviews with great character designers and exploring their unique processes. Highly recommended!", "This was a great course! It was cool to see the perspectives of different artists. I only wish there had been more of them, with more different styles (What about someone who is more realistic? What about someone who is super stylized in a different way?)

I especially liked watching other designers create characters from scratch - seeing and hearing about the process other designers use to turn their ideas into a character they can use in a game - even animated characters - was particularly helpful. After completing this course, I now have many different character designs I can potentially use in my own games, along with awesome feedback from peers to make my character designs even better! I recommend this course to anyone interested in getting into game design and development.", "It is powerful and enlightening for those who want to go into the field of design of video games, design of characters, and simply story telling.", "I liked the talks a lot but didnt expect to be forced to draw :)", "Guest artists were AMAZING and the weekly exercises productive. Thanks Fran.", "An awesome class to learn character design", "Lots of useful information.", "Not only did I learn more than I ever thought I would, but I had fun, as well! In fact, I liked this course so much that I've enrolled in another course offered within the same specialization.", "soooo much fun!!!", "Enjoyed a lot!", "coolest stuff ever, please do more of them so I can tell people to join the course", "A very good experience, but if it could've helped me to find a job it would have been even better.", "It's a great course I strongly recommend. Not only you are going to practise different character design through various exercises, but you are going to watch some great artist talking about their work while they are drawing. So interesting!", "I really enjoyed this class a lot! Taught me a few things about designing a character, for sure", "The interviews were great, and useful to see a real experienced designer, however the contents in the course were almost nonexistent. The homework was well planed but it depends much more in the student to learn something that the contents exposed in the videos. Tips aren't the same as methodologies and content in character design.", "there was 1 concept taught in the first lesson that of density. then it was loads of videos of other people drawing characters, not actually going through a design process. and then a few assignments designing a few characters . I was hoping to learn more about some of the principles of character design- wasnt blown away by this course wont be taking any more of these", "Compelling", "This course teaches a lot by talking professionals, each one gives something unique and that's great!", "Lots of fun to join in and nice easy pace to complete the assignments. Overall had an awesome time participating!", "An amazing course, I really enjoyed it ..", "very useful assignments .. opened my mind in different ways", "would have loved references or so ..", "It is cool. but it does not give any certificate of completion at the end as other courses do.", "This is one of my favorite courses since it encourages creativity and really contributes to good game design practices.", "Excellent course, learned a lot", "Great course I really enjoy it", "Amazing course!", "Awesome!", "Excellent! Sorry, I didn't do any assignments, but I really enjoy the course. The words of Robertryan Cory were brilliant! Cheers.", "One of the best courses I've ever taken on-line. Good explanations and artist's examples, and the assignments were awesome. Thanks!", "The 3 masterclasses are so awesome... You will not only learn a ton about character design, but also about professional work, design, communication... These 3 artists are so inspiring!", "Loved the different approaches to character design and the insight on the ideation and work processes of the different artists!", "Very interesting course, would definitely recommend it! Learned new things to refine and introduce into my own style.", "I believe that exaggerated the amount of minutes per video and lack of theory, but it was still a good course.", "great !!!", "I love the set up of this course - the fact that we get to sit in on artists as they draw and talk about the design/decision making process out loud.

I have taken basic inferential statistics at various levels in the past like 5 years, this is a really nice refresh and update (with respective the use of R). I would recommend this courses taught by Dr. Brian Caffo to others who are interested in the subject.", "To tackle such key concepts and tools of statistics, you need the appropriate time. Too much material covered in this course. I tend to think that revising the approach to this course as two 4 weeks modules would allow to both go more in depth at a more appropriate pace.", "I'm in the data science specialization. Statistical Inference was my 6th course. All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great.

I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.", "One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course. They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case. Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.", "Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...", "For the record, I almost aced this course. The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it. I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.", "The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst. I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities). Then I couldn't get motivated. 1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off. Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks. The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible). The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.", "(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).", "If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course. For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more. Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours. Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon (My partner was not pleased).", "Now here is where things get awkward. I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars. It accomplished something that some University courses could not. I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems. So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?", "Would I take the course again? I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification. If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn. In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.", "If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?", "So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars. If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority. If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.", "Learnt many new things. It was good.", "This course seems weirdly balanced between assuming one knows very little about statistics while also assuming one is intimately familiar with statistics notation and terminology. It would probably be better if the data science track had an optional \"intro to statistics\" class that can take more time to let students familiarize themselves with the terminology, and then a separate \"ins and outs of probability testing in R\" for those already familiar.

Quite thorough. Nice blend of R programming and theory.", "This is of course my personal opinion, with all due respect for the Tutors. Plus, it has to be noted that I am writing this as a Mathematics graduate, and this course was most probably not meant for people with any background. However, I have seen similar opinions from people like me. Probability calculus and statistics are both enormous areas of mathematics. Introducing them in a 4-week course seems a really bad idea to me. The probability part was in my opinion far better than the statistical, the origin of every new concept was clear. In my opinion, the optimal solution for the course would be to create a separate, longer course in PC and stats and require knowledge of the two for taking Data Science Specialization.", "For starters, it will demand a lot of out of class studies.

Also the many animations with the slides made it hard for me.", "This course should be in 3-4 courses.", "Maybe a full specialization", "I would say it is good quality content and appreciate the efforts of the authors . Though it just introduces the topic , it better to follow up with more rigorous online content/book, in order to understand the topic more deeply .", "So far this is the poorest course in DS specialiation. Coins and dices all the time, Brian reads to the camera. It is just like reading a book, a very boring one. Examples from real life could boost interest.", "This is a good course to set up for further learning. One gets exposure to topics in intro and intermediate statistic and starts to grasp how intricate the web of statistics it all the while the focus is on Hypothesis testing which is one cornerstones of statistics.", "Very helpful course", "A great course with great collection of tests and assignments. Great contribution by the teachers too!", "This course is very helpfull", "This course is clear and well structured, it is great that the author has created a companion book.", "This course is exciting opportunity to \"connect the dots\" in introductory statistics.

I struggled to understand the lectures and reconcile it back to the quizes.", "The course should be more elaborated. I had to go through other reference books on statistics to understand all the topics.", "The course is useful and essential not only for those studying statistics but machine learning", "The course is a very quick run through of basic statistics and not very intuitive for people without much statistics/maths background. The swirl exercises is a very good practical learning tutorial that supplements the course, but overall it still lacks on the conceptual aspect. Personally, I have to occasionally refer to other basic statistics materials to be able to follow the flow and understand the lectures.", "For the course project, there is a huge discrepancy in what the project expect the students to perform and the peer grading criteria. As a basic statistic course, the correctness of the estimation/ calculation/ assumptions is integral in any analysis but the grading criteria mostly neglect all this aspect. Hopefully the course admin can rectify this aspect of the course.", "Excellent.", "To be honest, I like the subject but found the course material and content not very well structured. I missed more mathematical foundation.", "It felt like there were a lot of jumps between basic statistical formulae and abstractions thereof. While I don't think it was inappropriate for a course on statistics in itself, it felt rather out of place in the rest of the sequence of this course.", "Great Course. Material much more challenging than courses in the program to date.", "Good course. It could be more clear and deep in some concepts, especially in the final part of week 4.", "Very Nice!", "Very disappointing!!!!!!!too much emphasis on mathematical notations....where are the practical applications?lack of examples....it seemed more of a prose than a lecture....would not recommend to a beginner.Period", "3.5 - Good, but I feel some of the explanations were over complicated a little compared to other coursers such as openintro to stats. Overall good experience though", "Pretty awesome", "Covers basic statistics (Mean, Variance, Simple Z and T tests). Not what I was expecting as Inference. Multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided, not adjusted for.

Thanks..", "It's not the math that is hard, it's the phrasing, vocabulary and semantics.", "Very Informative. Have to devote quite a bit of time to it though.", "I learned a great deal from this course. Methods, testing and most of all logical processes with proven with evidence. I understand this course only touches the surface, but it will serve me as a catalyst to continue exploring the field.", "Difficult one. But made it.", "Although the instructor is very good, it would be nice to have a direct link to more references that explains the basics without skipping certain steps that a beginner may find difficult. The course is pretty good and if the student is proactive he/she will find a way to self-learn those missing steps :)", "I am interested in taking the Regression Models course and took this one as a refreshment for the statistics knowledge I already had. I found the course well done and the resources easy to use and throughout.", "As a negative point I would mention that as the topics get more involved, the time dedicated to each one seems to decrease, to the point where both MULTIPLE TESTING and GROUP COMPARISONS are pretty much a briefing, which kind of defeates the purpose of including them on the course in the first place...", "I give the course a 8.5 out of 10.", "I thought the course material was great but I think the grading criteria for the assignment should be more rigorous and check for proper methodology/application of techniques, just because I'd like to know that my approach to a given data analysis is sound and that the conclusions I draw from running tests, p-value adjustment, calculating power, etc. are statistically valid.", "Overall a great primer! Thanks to Brian & Jeff for putting this together :)", "This is the toughest content yet of the Data Science specialisation but probably the most valuable piece so far. Video content is good but moves along very quickly so finding another book on statistics to back up the course content will be a great benefit.", "I've not found this course organized pedagogically speaking. The organization, insofar as \"here is a list of stuff I'll be teaching\" makes sense. But a lot of the \"teaching\" is ill suited for someone looking to learn with a minimal statistical background. It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening.", "Brian Caffo is explaining the Statistical Inference methodically, but he could work on making the lectures less tiresome and monotonous.", "The sections on bootstrapping and permutations were great! The instructor does much better, information is easier to follow (better and slower explanations), and the instructor is more engaging when he is not reading from his notes.", "Nicely outlined and broad in scope, but Brian's presentation is kind of dry. It often appears that he is reading off a script, and sometimes his emphasis on technical details takes away from ease of understanding.", "GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF USING STATISTIC TEST IN R. HOPE TO ADD MORE MATERIAL", "This course is great, but Brian is certainly not a good instructor. He does not explain things well, and articulate examples. I had to take Statistical Inference from Duke university to pass this course.", "Materials need to be updated - there are way too many inconsistencies between videos, exercises, and slides.", "I thoroughly enjoyed the swirl mode of interactive learning provided in the course. It helped me in understanding the power concept in statistical inference.", "Great course to learn about statistical inference, traditionally a tricky subject to teach. Well done!", "Probably more math than required at this stage", "This was the toughest of all the Data Science courses so far. Without the statistical inference book, the practical exercises and the swirls it would have been very challenging to pass the course. These were very valuable tools. The videos that are available when I couldn't get a practical exercise right, also helped me a lot.", "I majored in mathematical statistics 40 years ago, but have never used it in my whole career. But in my opinion this course explained the concepts much better than how it was done 40 years ago. Congratulations to everybody involved.", "I have learned so much and was really proud of myself when I passed this one.", "a basic course of inference but i think perfecto for this mooc", "I really like the use of media by this professor. The class itself is far more analytical and work than the preceding classes.", "I love the exercises in R. The class is really good and very interactive, you cannot get bored in any moment.", "If I wasn't already familiar with statistics, I would find the lectures and course book difficult to follow. If future revisions to the course are made, consider including a cheat sheet with the notation, parameter abbreviations used, etc. It would also be helpful to rewrite (or at least include a reference back to) the equation being used in the example calculations instead of immediately filling numbers in.", "Great course, very challenging . Well presented , great material .", "Understanding statistics is not easy, but caffo makes us to understand them easily... Thank you very much Mr. Caffo Now i can say that i know some statistics.", "A lot of the concepts in Stats Inf - although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day - I felt were difficult to understand at first. Wikipedia and some other online sources, and youtube videos, were more helpful but I think the real issue lay in the teaching style. I won't knock Mr. Caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently. What works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirements.", "My rating is purely based on the content which I think can be simplified by giving more visual examples. I am rating this after taking the 'Regression Models' course and in that course it is MUCH easier because he gives \"real time\" and visual examples of what, eg Residuals, mean or represent. Just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the R code rather than trying to understand the math. Hope this helps!", "Excellent!", "This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.", "The only reason for enrolling is to complete the data science specialization, though it may make you reconsider continuing with it. The instructor and provided materials fail to adequately explain the concepts this course is supposed to cover, and do not prepare students for the quizzes or assignments. If you don't know statistics you won't learn it here. If you know statistics, you don't need this course.", "Great course ! Important for those who are either going to take the Regression analysis or those who are working with data and want to do same basic hypothesis testing.", "It is nice course!", "Amazingly challenging, thought provoking.", "Brian is a very good lecturer. Even though he is knowledgeable, he goes through everything step by step and makes sure you don't fall off the wagon at any point. I had fun doing this course!", "Sometimes videos was difficult to understand. I needed to watch most of lectures twice. On other hand it was worth doing and I've learned basic statistics.", "The course on statistical inference is a crash course on frequentist statistics; in my opinion the contents are appropriate for statistical inference, though most of the concepts that are taught deserve more attention, or perhaps split throughout other courses.", "Nevertheless, Brian makes a terrific job to compress all of these topics into a single month course which is impressive - for someone familiar with statistics it's actually an enjoyable course.", "The course is good, but not very challenging. Anybody having done any course in statistic would have little to no information from the first two weeks. Only week 4 was interesting to me, dealing with boostrapping.", "The teacher is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.", "Informative course", "Very clear and useful. Excellent course", "This course is poorly taught. The instructors often speed through significant concepts and are generally unable to explain the concepts clearly to someone who does not have a major statistics background.", "Excellent course to know the basics of data science", "1) Not worth the money and time. The reason I say this is because the same concepts are reviewed and explained in lot more fun, creative, and interactive manner at other free of cost resources like Khan academy, youTube channels, etc", "2) Who is the audience? I don't think instructor has any idea of target audience. Are these meant for novice or advanced learners ?", "3) Why so serious? My philosophy is that if I want to appear in video, i better learn to cheer up. Seriously i mean after dealing with rush hour traffic and psychopath boss, I don't want to see a unhappy serious looking face throughout a course. Not good for my heart!", "Sorry if it is a mean (not statistic mean!) or anything but I have come here investing my money and time (out of my family time) . And I am not happy with this course.", "The only reason I have to complete this course is because of the requirement in specialization degree. I won't mind getting my refund back on this course.", "Despite the pertinent content, the way the instructor gave the classes could have been way more intuitive. You'll find videos on the web that can help you with the subjects covered and do a better job explaining the concepts. Disappointing.", "There are better (Free!) courses out there to learn basic inferential statistics. Khan Academy is a great place to start, and Udacity has a great class that gives a good intuitive understanding. The main reason to take this class is if you are trying to finish the entire Data Science program. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an intro stats class. The instructor clearly knows the material, the class just does not do a good job of transfering that knowledge.", "The instructor is about as convoluted as you can possibly get with his explanations.", "If, like me, you do not have an understanding of the subject matter then you may struggle to complete this in the time frame. I had to retake this multiple times and found getting the basics (From Khan) first then returning helped me finally understand and pass the tests.", "Well balanced course with a lot of practical examples which help to understand the theory. I apply statistical inference methods myself, and nevertheless I've found new topics here. Thank you!", "I liked this course, and found the lectures interesting and would give them perfect marks on being instructive. However, I found that there are some speling errors here and there, and a remarkable frequency of sirens audible in the lectures (is JHU in a difficult neighborhood?), and sometimes it was hard to recover the plots from the git repository.", "But, more importantly the curriculum and teach was very good, and the use of examples after the theory makes it much easier to grasp difficult concepts.", "Touches all the key concepts of statisticas inference. A bit challenging, even more if you don't have previous knowledge of statistics.", "lectures notes is not details enough, had to google around other materials to grasp the courser work better", "The instructors approach in this course is very cursory. He tries to split the difference in going through the mechanics/mathematical theory and practical applications. As a result, he fails at both. I think it would be better to leave the mathematics and application learning to supporting materials and focus on explaining the theory and concepts of statistical inference in the lectures.", "I have to admit, that most of the videos confused more than they helped. For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated. I have the same issue with the next course.

Bayes rule is introduced and appears in the homework but no where else. Things appear on the quiz that aren't in the home work or lecture. This was put together from scraps of another lecture, but in an incoherent fashion. When Caffo tells the viewer that they'll need to use other resources, he wasn't kidding. I dropped this the first time when I kept introducing things that completely had not been introduced, took another stats class, then came back and aced it. I don't mind accelerated learning or using other resources, but there's guide for which concepts are needed and where coverage for them can be found. This leaves little recourse but to know stats already, or go learn it before taking this course. Otherwise you don't know enough to even go find the pieces you need. Incidentally, the dude who does the lectures for Khan Academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch, though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more. If that's the case, I can't say enough good things about Biostatistical Analysis by Zar but thoroughly, logically categorizing statistical methods with short, clear examples, references to the original research, and building up one concept after another in logical order. The chapters are short, but the first 16 or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class. As it is, Caffo's presentation needs some serious testing and remodeling, but there's no indication that it'll match what Khan Academy did regardless of how much work goes in. At best, it's a bitter pill you can swallow if you already know the concepts.", "Nice.", "This was probably the most difficult and challenging course .

Truly, Coursera, what happened to your open education offering real education?", "The class was very interesting, because of the freedom that we had to practice the imagemaking processes, but the tone and voice of the teacher is not very dynamic and could have been more encouraging and communicating with the students.", "They say a picture can speak a thousand words. It is true!", "A very good course, not just for those who want to become experts, but also for those who know more.", "I learned a lot esp the extent of using materials to create an artwork. Well done!", "A weaker version of \"Fundamentals of Graphic Design\" with way too much overlap. It should not be included in the Specialization.", "This course gave me so much confidence not only in creating images and experimenting, but in writing too. I started to think out of the box and became more productive!", "Excellent I really enjoyed it", "Thank you ! awesome introduction!", "Good course, maybe more detailed information would be better.", "Great course!", "Very interesting through creative assignments you can learn and refine things about image telling.", "One of the most enjoyable courses for me. It was really fun to do all the assignments and to practice different ways to express myself. A very very nice way to lear. Thank you!", "Great course!", "Fun course but everything was already covered on the Fundamentals Of Graphic Design Course.", "I am running out of words to describe how much I loved taking this class and those in conjunction with it. I'll be a little sad when it's over and I'm taking the last course. There is a true connection", "I really loved the course and am extremely thankful for the opportunity.", "Muy recomendable.", "\u633a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4eba\u6709\u70b9\u4e0d\u9002\u5e94\u8001\u5e08\u7684\u6388\u8bfe\u65b9\u5f0f", "Good course if you are driven and can teach yourself. I like the instructor's approach. I'm giving 3 stars only because I was looking for something more about techniques..", "great course once again!", "A great course. It took me out of my comfort zone of design ideas.", "You make me work... grab crayons and paint. And that's exactly the kind of things I needed to do to make images, just theory wouldn't make a thing. Very well structured course, the Coursera plattform is amazing!!! (pardon my english)", "I was quite disappointed with this class. The videos and instructions are very short and the information is lacking. When reviewing other classmates material it was quite clear that people were confused with the assignments because I saw such a huge range of submissions that were very different from each other.", "I found the material to be very similar to the first course in this specialization; both asked very similar things but this class didn't add much to the process.", "This course is good, although it repeats a lot from the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.", "Good for beginners!", "I loved it , going straight to the point and has very valuable tips", "ONe of the best available courses :)", "Very enjoyable and encouraging course - I haven't used watercolours since I was a child and this course prompted me to go back out and try them again!", "Not up to the standard of the previous two courses. The material was already covered in the first course - Fundamentals of Graphic Design - and nothing new was brought to the table. Even the assignments were a re-hash of the ones from the first course. I realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the \"making\" of multiple iterations of the images. I just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy.", "I really enjoyed the course and it helped me to start creating again.", "Very good course with fun and challenging assignments. My only criticism of this series of courses (the graphic design specialization) is the grading process and lack of instructor interaction. While the peer grading is setup so that it's not too difficult to receive a decent grade if you do the work, there is virtually no instructor feedback on assignments, which is a bit dissapointing. I realize this may be due to the huge number of students, but usually when I pay for a class, interaction and feedback from the instructor is part of the package. Perhaps if you did that, though, then the tuition cost would be much higher.", "I like how the weekly projects built up until we had our book at the end.", "Loved it. More non graded assignments would have been great.", "This course gave a great opportunity to explore one's creativity, with assignments that didn't require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression. However, I also found that it didn't give me the richness of principles and techniques that I've found in other courses in this sequence. I expect that, for an in-person course, this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content. In a peer review situation, the feedback is quite general and so doesn't take up the slack from the lectures. I suggest that Coursera work with the instructor to retain the current content, but produce much richer lectures that have concepts and principles which students can put into practice even after the course ends.", "Fun and informative. Very creative.", "From the lectures, we've got the techniques of making various types of images and also the basic points of making images and compose images.", "I loved LOVED this course and really enjoyed it. though I didn't see the last feedback from other students on my final project (Bookishness) and it is locked now... However, It is an amazing course and very useful!", "Very inspiring! The ideas and process I've learned with this course will certainly help me in my future projects.", "While I did enjoy this course, I found it to be less useful than the first two in the series. I also noticed a lot of repetition from the course before. I think my expectation was to learn more about imagemaking in a digital sense, but I'm still happy overall that I took this course and I can't wait to earn my specialization.", "Gail Swanlund is awesome. Her voice is amazing and fun to listen to. She explains things in a very creative way. So far, this has been my favorite among the Graphic Design Specialization courses. Still have two more courses to go yet!", "loved it", "Very practical, great exercise, easy to understand and follow through, the student doesn\u2019t need major computer programs or high quality technology in order to complete each assignment. The design of each assignment is made to use your imaginations, hands on tools and materials. Love the videos, clear, to the point beautiful made. Lots of room to work and do something quite good and unique if the student want! I am really having fun!", "Thank you!", "I really enjoyed the assignments! Her videos were different from the other two courses in the Specialization, and I enjoyed that! I loved that I could see her process so that I could attempt on my own. Highly recommended class!", "I started 2 Hours ago.... it's amazing, such good teachers !", "This course teach you to think out of the box and if you have the courage and try, you will take it for the rest of your life.", "I love taking courses by the California Institute of the Arts. With that being said this course wasn't the best. It seemed there was not enough information provided. The assignments were too simple. It also seemed like this very material was covered in an earlier course. At least it was available for everyone, not just those that paid. The critiques are the most important part and it was still provided for this course. For that reason alone I raised my review from 2 stars to 4.", "If you enjoyed the first course in this specialization, you'll enjoy this course, as it's much of the same. The class is more of an independent studio session rather than an instructional course. If you're looking to work with a single visual subject for a few weeks (but lack the discipline or knowledge to do so on your own), this course will benefit you. If you're looking to save money, perhaps stick to just the first class in the specialization (or take this one if you're only interested in image-making).", "I understand it was a more practical course but still more information would have been great. Same assignments but more information would have been great. Other courses had more videos.", "Very practical, short videos, lots of exercices to get going, very interesting course.", "GOOD COURSE", "I found the course videos quite dull and uninteresting. The topics covered could have been taught a lot better. I finished this course only because I wanted to get through the specialization course. I found that the course 'Fundamentals of Graphic Design' did an exponentially better job of explaining image making techniques and composition. The assignments in this course are reasonably good but the instruction videos can definitely benefit from some additional in-depth material.", "I really enjoyed this course and it was one of the most helpful along with the Typography course, but it felt a little impersonal and short on information when I compare this one to the previous ones. I would love to look at more examples of imagemaking and uses of hierarchy.", "Outstanding class. Very dynamic, inspiring and creative.", "Very poor instructions and not enough theory.", "Nothing interesting. Common information about nothing. Sorry", "Much of the course seemed to cover what was previously discussed. About the only thing this course did for me was to introduce me to In Design. The teacher was OK, but she seemed to lack enthusiasm, particularly when she was demonstrating the book-binding.", "Excelente", "Los ejercicios son tremendamente did\u00e1cticos y de muy buen gusto", "it is a fantastic course !", "This is a great course!", "I personally did not find it constructive enough to spend money on.", "It is way too general and basic. I expected something more articulated and not so elementary", "Great course!! Thanks again!!", "G", "I thought this course would be more fun and interesting but I find it VERY repetitive with the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.

They say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge (sending emails, opening a browser), but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level. Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.", "They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics. They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together. There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand. Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.", "The assignments are also a bit of a mess. All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'. They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work. But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work. It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet. You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works. I find this to be a very poor teaching method. You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things. Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect.", "Thank you!!", "Subtitle files helped me to understand the lessons", "and the explanation was well detailed", "Good course but I think it is better for peaple with some programming background and be prepered for third week, it is lot to do.", "a good course for a very beginner to learn android programing.it covers many useful aspects about java.and this course has demonstrated most of the idea of coding,so you won't get confused by its concept.", "Excellent course, it helped me reinforce my Java knowledge and learn the basis of Android development through many specialized tasks which I completed easily thanks to the hight quality professors and very detailed lessons.", "A great course which covers a lot of practical java!", "It is an excellent course for learning Java.", "Excellent course.I learned a lot of things from this course.

In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio. If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code.", "There is a desperate need for a glossary. The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...). If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same.", "Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill.", "As for \"We've organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each,\" that is absurd! If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch.", "I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions). And I'm sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn. The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call \"The Curse of Knowledge\" -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not.", "My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else. Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment. I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course.", "My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization.

However the slides could be really improved and make things concise for someone who is new to Java.", "Finally I was really disappointed by the assignments. I often spent more time reading and trying to understand a long assignment (which could be reduced to a few lines), than writing the solution.

It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course. The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent. I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor.", "It's a good course, but you do need programming experience. Also, takes twice as much time as they say, at least.

It was a great refresher on Java and gave a peek into the Android framework that is intimidating, but makes me want to learn more!", "First time I gave 1 star. Reason, lecturers are terrible. This deserves a report, if there was adequate reporting system on Coursera. I had a feeling like I was watching professors from school for disabled, and not an university. . . Course material is actually decent, but extremely badly presented. Sadly, I enrolled into second course as well, and hoping that one will be better, so I wont have to go through refund hell.", "Very Helpful", "It is told that to take this course, basic computer skills like sending emails and downloading files are necessary-this is a beginning level course. Then, in the first module, instructors talk about polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction. For someone who have no prior programming experience, these are definitely not suitable topics to start with. Moreover, students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz, although they know nothing about programming.", "I had some programming experience, so I was already familiar with these subjects. But the lectures were too boring to keep watching. I watched like 10 videos and learned nothing about the course subject.

A bright, aggressive, student could learn this material with help of online examples, etc. The basic language features, etc, are pretty straight forward, but the object oriented features are probably too advanced for someone 3 weeks into programming.

By far the best course of android.", "Excellent Course!", "I watched the videos and made the assignments without submitting.

I consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course gives you access to all the material. Also, not being able to take the quizzes makes the course meaningless.", "The best website to learn just about everything!", "The course is very well structured and instructors are very responsive in the forum.", "Very lengthy", "superb", "Now that I have completed the course I'd like to give some feedback on how I think it was.", "1. Quizzes are horrible. The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I can't get them correct. It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but I've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just can't get them right. If there was feedback after taking a quiz I'm sure it would of helped. For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right. It's not helpful and then it turns into a \"just keep selecting different things until it's right\" thing instead of understanding it.", "2. The course says it's for beginners to programming but I beg to differ. I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment. I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. Maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #3", "3. I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example. Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.", "4. Some material is not consistent. Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the Account example files", "5. It seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing pains", "Overall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java. For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, But I'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. I just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.", "I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background", "Content was good. But organization could have been better. Assignments and auto-grader had issues and the problem statements were modified during the course.", "I feel this course was severely misrepresented. This clearly not a beginner level class by any measurement. And the \"4-6 hours\" of expected student involvement is ridiculous. A beginner (NO programming experience) should expect to spend 15 to 20 hours on the first week alone and at least 10 hours for each of the remaining weeks.", "I have over 25 years of programming experience in Assembly language, Visual Basic, C and C++. I am clearly NOT at the beginner level yet I spent more than 11 hours on the first week, mostly due to trying to download and setup properly for the course. Also, there are over 3 hours of videos in the 1st week plus 3 quizzes and a programming assignment. If anyone spent less than 6 hours on week 1, then that was NOT the first time they took this class.", "I also am keenly disappointed in the restrictive nature of the assignments/quizzes. Having to type \"-1*1+11\" instead of \"-i+11\" (and you better not have any leading or lagging spaces!!) for instance.", "Bottom line, I would not recommend this course for anyone wanting to Learn Java for Android Programming unless you already know Java and just want some intro on Android development with Android Studio. And if you are indeed at the beginner level, do yourself a favor and start with introductory courses in Computer Science.", "Good course. First time enrolled course in Coursera. I really enjoyed it. Lots of quiz and weekly assignment kept me busy for 4 weeks. And because of these ( assignment due date), i really learned by forcing myself to complete all in time. Quite tough on week 3, and i watched the videos multiple times and google the subject in order to understand the contents. Take this course, and struggle for 4 weeks. Will not regret.", "The course is nice, lectures is fine.", "But assignments is a bullshit. The instructions are uncertain, with typos. There is random number used, and you have to do magic with your algorithm in order to match expected output.

Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.", "The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.", "Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done.

This great course let\u2019s you organize the tiles to see the big picture.I also find it very appropriate at management level. You get the elements necessary to envision a digital transformation project and communicate with all stakeholders.", "i see course must be require for every engineer ,that because the new technology and last updata of data", "This course is just definitions... and the next one as well. I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions), but I will check another course that is not so academic.", "This course is very informative, it discusses a broad of things regarding digital manufacturing, and it can put you on the right track by letting you know about the industrial revolutions, where are you standing, and which field do you want to proceed and work in. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start a career in manufacturing, even those who are already in the field and want to refresh their information or to know broader information regarding what they are missing, or want to upgrade their factory's systems. I recommend it also to engineering students, and young technicians. Good luck everyone!", "It was very usefull information. Our Trade Center would have at 24 th of february this month a conference about Industry 4.0 I would be proudly inform taht I would be qualified soon and I already aware of it.", "Gives a good insight of what really Digital manufacturing m", "Everything very very good, except discrepancies grading the final quiz of m1w2...

This course is hard for the new comer of Ruby on Rails and MongoDB. Assignment is a challenge job, sometimes assignment is a huge job. Suggest that better break down the assignment which over 30 pages. Maybe make this course from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, that is better.", "Very comprehensive insight into the topic", "A most excellent course! I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My only comment is that the time estimates were way off for me -- I ended up spending up to four times as long as the estimate, on each week's assignment. But it was worth it.", "I was excited to learn a bit about using document-based databases and JSON parsing and transport. However, for me the approach in this course was very dry and I found the material, goals, and teaching style to be a confusing jumble. It seemed like each section/module did not feel like a cohesive package, with each one building upon the last.", "I just love Ruby on Rails, and this course is awesome!", "I thought this course was really challenging and that made it worth it. I was expecting the course to just be \"here's another type of database, and here's how to use it in Rails\". But they went into all the features unique to Mongo. They showed things you can't do in ActiveRecord. The last project being an introduction to making APIs was great too. It really got me thinking about all the types of web apps I could make.", "This is a great course. It is challenging, but that comes with the territory if you want to write code. I like the fact that the assignments are challenging and long; the only issue I had is that I work full-time and hardly have the 20+ hours a week to spend on the programming assignments. Also, the estimated times listed for each assignments are not realistic for somebody learning the topics in this course for the first time. I would recommend this course to anybody wanting to learn how to develop web apps and api web services using Rails with MongoDB as the backend. Just be prepared to dedicate a lot of time each week. Especially week3's assigment. I ran out of time and had to transfer to a new session to complete the course because of my full-time job. It would be beneficial for students to have a spare week, in between the third and fourth assignment.", "Very long assignment", "Hard course but satisfying also. Practice exercises are quite long, and sometimes a little hard to read and understand (I say so as a non native english speaker)", "This course was challenging, with a lot of new things to learn since MongoDB was used, first without a gem and the using it to really understand what we were doing. The staff is active and responsive! Thank you all!", "This was a very challenging course, especially the programming assignments. However, it is very worthwhile.", "Poor alignment between assignments and lectures. Lots of content poorly explained.", "The material was was too much for the estimated time given to spend on the course per week. The assignments are very lengthy and the grading doesn't always conform to what would be intuitive.", "Some gems used in the course material are also old versions. There are entries in the db seed data that cause trouble, leading to intensive debugging and modification of given files that require a much more experienced programmer to figure out.", "I am a full-stack developer working mainly with Ruby on Rails.", "I took this course to learn about MongoDB and how it can be used with Rails, as well as to pick up certain aspects of Rails that I have not been using as much (like JBuilder)", "The materials and assignments are very detailed, which shows that a lot of effort has gone into them. Although some of the work turned out to be more time-consuming than expected, I enjoyed going through it and seeing the results.", "Good course about NoSQL MongoDB. I learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with Unix machines like Macs. He used windows and in many cases I would run into problems like running Mongoid by including Gem files that he provided. I had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting StackOverflow every time to sort out technical issues.", "Es un curso muy largo, con pr\u00e1cticas que pueden llegar a ser muy complejas y costosas de terminar", "At this point, after 3 courses, I can say that I am more then competent enough for great freelancing. I can only imagine how will my skill-set look after next two courses and final capstone project. Thanks a lot, JH Ruby team!", "Overall good course with a lot of examples. Though, some important steps seems to be missing, so could not follow along with all the demos. Had to spend some unpredictable amount of time digging into some questions (probably, it is fine, but the difference between 2 previous courses and this one in the program is vivid). I had a problem installing 'doorkeeper-mongodb' and it does not seem that this problem for a number of users. Good that it was not in the final project.", "I recommend this course to anyone who wants to start learning about document-oriented data model databases.

Mostly because some core requirements of the assignments were not explained in the lectures. I spent more time searching google for information than I did the lecture videos because A. the lecture videos are not named or indexed in such a way as to make it easy to figure out which video to rewatch and B. in many cases the particular thing I was trying to do wasn't covered at all. It may be the instructors teaching style to get you to research yourself but I could have done that without paying for the course.", "Great course with a lot of practical work, that makes you not only know subject, but also feel it by the tops of your fingers.", "The course's assignments (3 so far) are not very well designed.", "It takes me more time to search online and on the lecture's videos for information than to actually write and come to a solution. The lecture's videos show very little coding and they're more focused on explaining (redundantly) a key concept.", "I believe it would be much more easier for other people taking this course later on if the videos were more code-oriented.", "Greetings.", "I would give this course 0 stars if possible.", "I am amazed that anyone rated this course better than 1 or 2 stars!", "The lectures are not focused on the information that is necessary for the obnoxiously long and tedious assignments.", "The assignments are poorly written and demand too much Ruby expertise for a course meant for Ruby novices. I spent over 15 hrs trying to complete week 2's assignment and still could not finish. I became so frustrated and actually angry at how difficult this course is designed I decided to quit. Coursera should not allow there to be courses that evoke such frustration and emotion. John Hopkins should be embarrassed that their name is associated with the pedagogical malpractice that is this specialization series.", "Foolishly, I paid for the entire specialization up front and Coursera refuses to refund me for the remaining two courses. (which I have not even taken)", "Good contents but a bit over-complicated assignments.", "Great course! I'm really enjoying this specialization", "Hi there, this course was great but i will recommend to split the large lectures in 2 and add more dynamic content and make the examples in rails project instead of the console will be great this course has been in the end a bit boring because i the professor need to be more fluid and make it more funny! for say it in some way for everything else it was a great course thanks you!", "Great way to learn about MongoDB and it's integration with Rails framework.", "Awesome course!! Thanks Coursera!!", "Not such a great course. Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignments. Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took. Just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you.

Best course so far in the specialization.", "All the information and content given is great and necessary to work with mongo db. unfortunately, the timing and pacing is really tough because it relies on pretty long assignments. Take this course if you can handle going through 20 pages of instructions for a homework or 2, or you need a fast paced review of mongo and mongoid coupled with rails.", "The layout of this course is extremely well reasoned out. Each module gives important stepping stones for the students both to understand and to get practical skills to use the material after the course. For me it was an extra bonus to learn about teh Rails API in the 4th week of the course. I will surely need that in the future. All assignments include very thorough guidance on how you can check your own work one step at a time all the way through. In fact I have never before attended a course where so much effort had been but into that part by the teachers. Much praise for that. The graded assignments were hard. I had to put in a quite considerable effort in each of them, especially week 3. Much more work than I had anticipated. However I cannot point to any part of the material that could easily have been left out. Everything we learned seemed useful and important. So in spite of the hard work I am happy that I stayed in there to the end.", "Too raw.", "This is definitely one of the best courses I have taken online.", "If you are interested in learning Rub on Rials with MongoDB,", "stop reading this comment and sign-up.", "Nice course about rails and mongoid, awesome", "Unacceptable assignments length! The reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload. It took me 2 weeks (not 6 hours as tutor mentions) to complete half of the second assignment and I am about to tell that I learnt nothing about MongoDB. The videos cover the very basics and in order somebody to complete the assignments needs searching in the internet. The videos must change to include more details about the presented topic.", "I am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course.", "An unexpectedly disappointing, and in fact, downright awful course. The lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implemented in the assignments. The assignments themselves inherit the nice modular spec-test driven spirit of the first two classes. However, the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading, occasionally dropping some \u201chints\u201d, which are often either not helpful, or just offer to copy-paste a quarter page of code. The tasks are very (and by \u201cvery\" I mean EXTREMELY) long, tedious, boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are trolling the students. How about a 53 (yes, that is fifty three!) pages of assignment for the 3d week? To be fair, not all of this is the task statement, there is a lot of test code as well, but you know.. even one third of 53 is an impressive volume for a 4 weeks course (you get re-enrolled if you fail to be fair). Took me 44 hours of pure coding time (according to WakaTime) to finish the course. I have passed tens of courses on Coursera, and this one is by far the worst. That is taking into consideration that I would not rather call any other course (of those I have taken) \u201ca bad one\u201d. I suggest saving time and money by buying a book on Mongo and another one on Rails instead. I do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and I will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete.", "Really great course, make me understand a lot about rest and HTTP", "Great instructor!", "Congratulations", "course work is too hectic. its hard for some one who is new to web app development and new to ruby! but over all strength and content of the course is good.", "Thank you!", "Excellent!"], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/roadmap-success-digital-manufacturing-design": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-economic-networks": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/cluster-analysis": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital-analytics": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-mining": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/reviews-and-metrics-for-software-improvements": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing-2": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamedev-platforms": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning": [], "https://www.coursera.org/learn/usable-security": []}
